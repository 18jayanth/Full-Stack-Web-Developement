<div>,<p>,<h> are  block level elements
<span>,<input>,<img> are inline element
but if u keep it in a container which is flexible then,
it will remove all the previous rules and tries to display all in one line
and applies its properties to all elements

flex box always applies on container that holds the elements

align-items:stretch streches elements opposite to flex direction but the container should be flex and not inline-flex
flex-basis increases size of each content in the container should apply for children not container

Basics of Styling README
1. Headings

Use # symbols (like HTML <h1> to <h6>).

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6


👉 Example:

Heading 1
Heading 2
Heading 3
2. Paragraphs & Line Breaks

Just write text normally.
For a new line → add two spaces at the end or use <br>.

This is a normal paragraph.  

This is another line (with double spaces).  
Or use <br> like this.

3. Text Styles
**Bold Text**  
*Italic Text*  
***Bold + Italic***  
~~Strikethrough~~  


👉 Example:
Bold, Italic, Bold+Italic, Strikethrough

4. Horizontal Line
---

5. Lists

Unordered list

8. Videos / GIFs

Direct video embedding doesn’t work in GitHub Markdown, but you can:

Add a link:

[Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)


Or show a thumbnail that links to the video:

[![Alt Text](https://img.youtube.com/vi/dQw4w9WgXcQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)


👉 Example (clickable thumbnail):


9. Emojis

Use GitHub-supported emojis: :smile:, :rocket:, :fire:
👉 Example: 😄 🚀 🔥

10. Stickers / Badges

Badges make your README attractive.

✅ With all these, you can make your README professional, engaging, and recruiter-friendly.
